## Running the Solutions

### Java Solutions

Navigate to the appropriate year's java directory:

```bash
cd 2024/java  # or 2015/java
javac dayX.java
java dayX
```

**Note**: Update the file path in the source code to use test input:
- Change `../input/dayX.input` to `../input/dayX.test` for sample data

### Go Solutions

Navigate to the Go directory:

```bash
cd 2024/go
go run dayX.go
```

### Rust Solutions

Navigate to the Rust directory:

```bash
cd 2024/rust
cargo run dayX    # or dayX_2 for part 2
```

## Input Files

- `*.input` - Actual puzzle input (not tracked in git)
- `*.test` - Sample input provided in problem descriptions

To use your own input:
1. Download your input from the Advent of Code website
2. Save it as `dayX.input` in the appropriate input directory
3. Ensure the file path in the solution matches your input file

## Key Features

### Performance Optimizations
- **Day 6 Rust Implementation**: Optimized for performance-critical pathfinding
- **BigInteger Usage**: Java solutions use BigInteger for large number calculations (Day 7)
- **Efficient Data Structures**: HashMap and HashSet implementations for fast lookups

### Algorithm Highlights
- **Bitwise Operations**: Day 7 (2015) implements a circuit simulator with bitwise logic
- **MD5 Hashing**: Day 4 (2015) uses MD5 for proof-of-work style calculations
- **Grid Traversal**: Multiple days feature 2D grid navigation and pathfinding
- **String Processing**: Advanced regex and string manipulation techniques

## Development Notes

### Code Organization
- Each solution is self-contained with its own main method
- Input parsing is consistent across solutions
- Error handling includes proper file exception management

### Testing
- Test files are provided for verification
- Solutions can be easily switched between test and actual input
- Debug output available in most implementations
